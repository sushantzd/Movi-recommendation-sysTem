This project demonstrates the implementation of a content-based movie recommendation system using the TMDB 5000 Movies and Credits datasets. The system recommends movies based on the similarity of content attributes such as genres, keywords, and more.

Key features:

* Data preprocessing and cleaning of movie and credit datasets.

* Content-based filtering using similarity metrics.

* Visualization of data and model outputs to better understand the recommendations.
